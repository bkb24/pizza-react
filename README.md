This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

This is a test task for arranging pizza ordering situation. The focus is on the ordering process and working with different currencies.
The tools used are create-react-app, and the ContextAPI and a negligent ammount of Bootstrap. 

## Functions on the application

It works with a Laravel API and auth system. The user can order and 'checkout' witout an account. But if they have one, they can save their address and contact details for future orders. 

There are 3 types of users: Regular, Manager and an Administrator. The Administrator has been given all the power they can have. The manager can add and delete products and deal with orders - cancel or confirm. But they can not add or take any privileges of any other user. The Regular user just has a history of previous orders and can cancel their unconfirmed orders.

All the prices can be converted within the currency that the user chooses between Euro and Dollars. After thay choose this stays as their permanent choice until the session expires. The exchange rates are given from the backend, that makes and API call to a third-party API to get te latest rates.


## Create eact app things
--------------------------
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
